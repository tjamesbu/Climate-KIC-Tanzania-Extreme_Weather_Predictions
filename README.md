# Climate-KIC

## Problem Statement/Goal
Unpredictable weather conditions caused by climate change are leading to severe adverse effects such as floods, heat waves, and other extreme weather events in Tanzania. These conditions result in significant property damage, displacements, and fatalities. Currently, there is a lack of tailored preparedness measures, specific location pinpointing, and timely alerts, leading to inadequate disaster response and low accessibility of vital information.

**Goal: Develop a robust AI-powered early warning system to predict extreme region-specific weather conditions, specifically floods, heavy rains, and heat waves in Tanzania with at least 80% prediction accuracy.**
